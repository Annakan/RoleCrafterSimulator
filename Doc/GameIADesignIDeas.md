# Ideas

## Going Min Max ?

## Going Neural ?

## What state do we need ?

At each turn state is limited :

* Endurance counter
* Energy counter
* remaining crafter cards 
* the lanes cards and tools and free slots
  * Active Card Effects
  * Active slot modifiers
* The reserve cards and tools and free slots

## Can we write an evaluation function ?
